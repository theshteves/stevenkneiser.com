        Be patient with my tiny servers who are very hard at work preparing your email. They&apos;re stacked shoulder-to-shoulder in a crowded data center in the cloud at very cold temperatures so that they do not overheat after giving it their all. They&apos;re about to seal it in a digital envelope of the finest digital paper that digital money can buy. After that, they&apos;ll stamp it with love (& presumably bitcoin) before placing it gently in the digital mailbox. They do not rush perfection. so it may take a few extra milliseconds.
