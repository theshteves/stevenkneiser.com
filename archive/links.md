This is my "Best Of":
<br />my running list of links shared most

This list continues to evolve today & I'll continue to fight the temptation to bloat it over time. I may post other best-of's individually, but this is the home for my consistent top performers. I have a recency bias where I write about my most recent obsessions, but this is a home for sticky ideas that have withstood the test of more time (& my attention-span).

On final review, this list is more US-centric than I'd prefer, so I encourage people to check out this [world map of the world by population](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram){:target="\_blank"} & this [animated world map of twitter activity over one month (2013)](https://vimeo.com/347801005){:target="\_blank"}. The internet isn't just your country, so this map gives you  a better feel for who you'll be interacting with in the future.

## [How aging will kill you<br />& what you can do about that](https://youtu.be/vDFxdkck354?t=478){:target="\_blank"}

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vDFxdkck354?start=478" title="Peter Attia - Reverse engineered approach to human longevity" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Don't worry, there's no strong-arm philosophy/product/pitch at the end here: just a survey of some exploratory research.

Here's Peter, both an engineer & accomplished medical doctor, speaking to a room
of medical researchers so don't expect to follow every detail of this
discussion, but this is a great summary of some of the best current thinking on how to
not let aging sneak up on you so much.

Seeing an ordered list of aging-related disease based on likelihood really
reframed how I think about taking care of my body. There's an old-person
survival olympics that you have decades to train for & it looks nothing like
training for the normal olympics.

### [r/personalfinance flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics){:target="\_blank"}

_(Specific to the U.S.)_

The art of investing is the art of decision-making. Every decision you make is a vote for the person you'll become. **This is the lazy-yet-informed approach to maximize your returns _relative to your risk & effort_**. The "20% of effort that will yield you 80% of the results"

In my experience,
<br />you'll take this 1 of 2 ways
<br />(assuming this is news to you):

Some people are so ecstatic that they binge this kinda stuff for months, but
others...<br />let's just say<br />it's not their idea of fun

* TODO: why that's not this case

The secret is that you have a backwards case of "grass is greener". Ignorance is not bliss & you know it: it eats away at you from the inside until you're a hollow shell of your former self. Getting clear on "your finances" is the only antidote to stress, the only therapy of its kind. For many, thinking about money is like having to stare into the abyss of their problems, when it's actually more like roping off a crime scene & getting the victims the answers they deserve.

You may think you have nothing, that you're doomed, but a quick google search will find you many stories of people that have gotten out of significantly more dire financial circumstances. Just because you have 40k/80k/120k in student loan debt & several thousand in credit card debt is far from the end of the world.

The grass really is greener on the other side

<br />

I wrote recently about ["Whose Ladder Are You Climbing?"](https://creatorswhocode.com/blog/whose-ladder){:target="\_blank"} precisely because this ladder is the only one worth climbing (& the top of it is probably _way_ lower than you think)

> _"How come there's no 'life essentials' class in high school??? I wish
> someone had taught me earlier about budgeting, taxes, how to change a tire"_
> <br />--every American's uncle

This is your foundation. This isn't the be-all end-all on the art of investing for people who've entirely escaped the game of money, but this is the most sustainable path _to get you there_.

<br />

...oh & if you're a trigger-happy capitalist who wants to YOLO more than 1% of your net worth into speculative investments, then live your life BUT if you don't at least understand these fundamentals in & out, you haven't earned the right

> _"Rule #1: never lose money<br />Rule #2: never forget rule #1"_<br />--Warren Buffett

> _"A fool & his money are soon parted"_<br />--[proverb]

<br />

That's my plea
<br />& I hope you'll thank me
<br />for not burying it further down

_P.S. Your parents called ðŸ“ž<br />they want to know when you're finally going to get a haircut & a "real" job_

Their words, not mine

### [2 decades of inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease){:target="\_blank"}

_(Specific to the U.S.)_

You might not care about economic theory, but this single graph explains so much of the current economy around us [in the U.S.]. **In the last 20 years, what goods & services have become more expensive dollar-for-dollar & by how much?**

You may be familiar
<br />with _the general idea_ of inflation
<br />& how $80 was _"actually a pretty big deal"_ in 1910,

but not every dollar is equal [in the way you thought],
<br />so let's peak behind that curtain _...by sector_

![Baumol's Cost Disease](/assets/img/cost-disease.webp){:style="width:100%"}

Worth noting "average hourly wages"
<br />isn't the same as _median_ hourly wages,
<br />since ~1971 there's been a
<br />...rather controversial divide

These are the waters you might not have realized you're swimming in. Outside of the "he said : she said" noise of day-to-day politics, this is the playing field that tells 80% of the story. We're all processors in the same societal super-computer grinding our gears towards better solutions to this problem.

<br /><br />


### [A case for optimism](https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world){:target="\_blank"}

ALRIGHT! Now on to the fun stuff!

Include link to their world map by population instead of surface area. This would change a lot of how we understand the cultural distribution of we interact with online & will only become increasingly noticeable

<br /><br />


### [How Software Is Eating The World](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1){:target="\_blank"}

Let me be clear, this is a book-length collection of essays elaborating on the ideas of someone who invented the original, graphical web browser & has gone on to run one of the most successful venture capital firms funding countless software companies who lay the landscape for the world you live in today. While the lead writer may drop more SAT words than you've seen in a while, this is a masterful summary of how _...software is eating the world._

For all you "non-technical" folks who don't have Computer Science degrees, I'd commit to whichever 3-5 chapters most grab your interest. You've heard "transformational technology" enough times to question "really? When I look back in history, I don't see any comparison of this much sustaining innovation. Is this all just hype propping up a failing system? How far can this revolution _really_ go?" ...this might be the most thorough introduction to open your eyes.

<br /><br />


### [Theory of Constraints](https://fortelabs.co/blog/theory-of-constraints-101/){:target="\_blank"}

This is an entire series of essays on a hidden gem of the manufacturing industry. People around me today in software probably don't know that "Agile" & agile methodologies are little more than a paintjob over this more timeless idea from a much less sexy industry (which is one reason they dressed it up in new clothes)

* TODO: include Lindy Effect, etc

<br /><br />


### [All you need is 10](https://seths.blog/2009/04/first-ten/){:target="\_blank"}

"but Globalâ„¢ this! Macroeconomicâ„¢ that! Geopoliticalâ„¢ these!"

Good news! You can build a calm life in your own backyard. This is calm amidst the storm. **This is soothing wisdom from an age of distraction**.

In an era of infinite leverage, it's a seductive fantasy to try to extract a tiny value out of lots of people, even millions.

Seth is a master of moderation
<br />with a focus on generosity
<br />who inspires by example

He doesn't "try to change the world"
<br />He just shows up every day

After 5 years of consuming every thoughtpiece that gives the faintest smell of entrepreneurship, this is one of my top 5, it came to mind second. What makes it better than any other though is raw simplicity. Unlike the others, this is the most timeless. It will never go out of style. It doesn't have any prerequisites. It doesn't even give you permission to procrastinate by reading another follow-up article.

First, 10.
<br />& they'll take it from there
<br />but only once your stuff is good enough

When is it good enough?

When you can stop pushing
because they've started pulling
because they're getting value from you

<br />

Create for 10, not 10,000

First, 10.
<br />& they'll take it from there
<br />but only once your stuff is good enough

BONUS: study his writing for a masterclass in simplicity (this blurb was longer than his average post)

<br /><br />


### [Everything Is A Remixâ„¢](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series){:target="\_blank"}

Being original is overrated, but more importantly it's not realistic

> _"Good artists copy. Great artists steal."_

<br /><br />


### [Small Business 2.0 Revolution](https://stackingthebricks.com/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first/){:target="\_blank"}

Alright, this is second entrepreneurship one that repeatedly comes to mind as arguably the important concept

<br /><br />

### [Has The West "lost it"?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1AY9H89tTY){:target="\_blank"}

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1AY9H89tTY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An uncomfortable, but necessary wake-up call for us in the U.S. who do not expect our 4.25% of the world population to always hold the same sway on the global stage. Regardless of whether you buy the argument, you need to hear this perspective that doesn't fit naturally into the polarized narratives or culture wars within the U.S.

The other 95.75% of the world, not to mention the future, have narratives of their own.

<br /><br />

### [Against Waldenponding](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding){:target="\_blank"}

When's the last time you've heard this:

> _"Ugh, we just need to disconnect more & get away from it all"_

...it's one thing to savor the time you get to be around friends & family, but perhaps the fantasies of taking months at a time away from society aren't what they're cracked up to be. I love this stuff so much because I've never heard this counter-argument: it makes me feel equally more & less at peace with the world today. That's a paradox I love to lean into.

### [You don't have to be local](https://sive.rs/local){:target="\_blank"}

This was a simple article that tapped me at the right time: it gave me
permission. This realization is slwowly dawning on people all over the world.
The more friends you make in different countries & timezones, the more you
question how you distribute you time. ClubHouse/Twitter Spaces/etc shrink that
distance down to your room. There are multiple conferences going on all around
you in this city in the sky.

I just didn't realize I even had a choice

<br /><br />


### [The biggest name in environmentalism changed their mind on urbanization, nuclear energy, & more over a long lifetime](https://e360.yale.edu/features/stewart_brands_strange_trip_whole_earth_to_nuclear_power){:target="\_blank"}

Although even millenials might not recognize his name, Stewart Brand [TODO]. He now prefers the term eco-pragmatist. We can't go back & we can't afford to slow innnnovations on the horizon. Even if you're a proud tree-hugger who thinks that _"industrial civilization has committed crimes, sins against nature, and retribution is coming"_ ...then he's a respectful, sympathetic voice who learned some hard lessons.

We all have something to learn from someone who has been on the frontier of the environmental movement since the '60s & '70s. This is the only exception to my rule for this page because the exact link to him isn't as important as his perspective that has loomed over me.  There may be better summaries, but this short interview is a brief enough introduction to his current thinking.

<br /><br />


### [Improve your Air Quality](https://dynomight.net/air/){:target="\_blank"}

A data-driven rant on why you should care about Air Quality & what you should do about it

In an urbanizing world,
<br />sensitivity to air pollution outdoors AND indoors will probably continue to grow more relevant

_I promptly chucked my ultrasonic dehumidifier out the window after reading this_

<br /><br />


### Quotes

> _"Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact:<br /><br />everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it...<br /><br />Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again."_ <br />--[Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw){:target="\_blank"}

> _"...in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worshipâ€“be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principlesâ€“is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive."_ <br />--David Foster Wallace, [This is Water](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/){:target="\_blank"}

> _"...I am better off than he is---<br />for he knows nothing, and thinks that he
> knows: I neither know nor think that I know.<br /><br />In this latter particular,
> then, I seem to have slightly the advantage of him..."_ <br />--Socrates (not
> in English though) <br />... --Plato (as documented in his "Apology") <br />... ... --Michael Scott
