  &lt;p&gt;“I liked math because it was repeatable &amp;amp; objective&lt;br /&gt;
The other subjects were too ‘up to interpretation’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied engineering because I loved problem-solving&lt;br /&gt;
But the job market is unforgiving for academics&lt;br /&gt;
People speak from different languages &amp;amp; concerns&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College tests were consistent, built on an agreed-upon knowledge base&lt;br /&gt;
If none of my peers understood a problem, we’d curse the professor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These norms help researchers push the frontier of human knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
But most problems aren’t at the fringes of science; they’re between people&lt;br /&gt;
Newton figured out Calculus long ago, but billions are still unable to&lt;br /&gt;
The range of business problems dwarfs that of engineering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good engineers, consultants, &amp;amp; salespeople are skilled at finding solutions&lt;br /&gt;
But what makes one great is an ability to find a better problem&lt;br /&gt;
To not solve what emerges, but what brought it up&lt;br /&gt;
They aren’t paid to answer, but to further question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;problem-solving-isnt-about-the-solution&quot;&gt;Problem-solving isn’t about the solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s the answer?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problems with enough definition are already solved&lt;br /&gt;
Profound solutions aren’t “outside the box”&lt;br /&gt;
They come when you poke around each line to reveal the circle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already solved smaller problems&lt;br /&gt;
We even solved solving with computers&lt;br /&gt;
Stop grinding your gears when we have machines&lt;br /&gt;
The most worthwhile question is one you haven’t asked yet&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="design" /><category term="engineering" /><category term="business" /><summary type="html">“I liked math because it was repeatable &amp;amp; objective The other subjects were too ‘up to interpretation’”</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Cancel that meeting</title><link href="https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/cancel-that-meeting" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cancel that meeting" /><published>2019-05-08T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-05-08T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/cancel-that-meeting</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/cancel-that-meeting">&lt;p&gt;Does someone disrespect our time?&lt;br /&gt;
We decide whether their excuse will suffice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our clothes are dirty, should we let bacteria run its course&lt;br /&gt;
or put in the 5 minutes to get the soap bath going?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overexposure blinds us to smell&lt;br /&gt;
Tension in our relationships &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; air out but we both deserve better&lt;/p&gt;

A house is a general-purpose shelter&lt;br /&gt;
A home is a feeling of shelter: belonging &amp;amp; gratitude&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a day home is different from a night home&lt;br /&gt;
A home during the day offers community, opportunity, &amp;amp; a launchpad&lt;br /&gt;
A home during the night secures restraint, recovery, &amp;amp; reflection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night is for listening, not day talk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-night-your-armor&quot;&gt;Your night, your armor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we resist the night: we work too late&lt;br /&gt;
and we quarrel &amp;amp; quibble &amp;amp; squabble with family&lt;br /&gt;
Kicking or screaming, the night engulfs flame&lt;br /&gt;
It forces us into remission: fatigue, followed by sickness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does your night need for a better day?&lt;br /&gt;
You need others, but that is for day&lt;br /&gt;
Tonight needn’t be another fight&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="other" /><summary type="html">A home is different from a house A house is a general-purpose shelter A home is a feeling of shelter: belonging &amp;amp; gratitude</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Business is trust</title><link href="https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/business-is-trust" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Business is trust" /><published>2019-04-16T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2019-04-16T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/business-is-trust</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stevenkneiser.com/blog/business-is-trust">&lt;p&gt;Which sounds most painful?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;applying for jobs out of reach&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;asking a stranger on a date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;building a business that alone can sustain you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are transactions, and they require communication&lt;br /&gt;
If you want someone else’s time or money, then you need to earn their trust&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is a communication cache: when we trust, we needn’t say another word&lt;br /&gt;
In love, trust brings comfort &amp;amp; security&lt;br /&gt;
In business, trust brings money &amp;amp; success&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-i-know-you&quot;&gt;Do I know you?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your career in your 20s is largely stockpiling social proof&lt;br /&gt;
When an employer asks for your portfolio, they need social proof&lt;br /&gt;
They only &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; some of the employers who’ve &lt;em&gt;entrusted&lt;/em&gt; you before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Does Bill Gates need a résumé?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people start dating through a social circle&lt;br /&gt;
You can “go out” but what if some cutie already hangs out with your friends?&lt;br /&gt;
They already &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; you because enough people &lt;em&gt;they trust&lt;/em&gt; do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why building my first business alone was so. damn. hard.&lt;br /&gt;
People only buy when they &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; me to solve their problem&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Nothing matters&lt;/strong&gt; until I can prove it to them in their own language&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How long did I take to build that trust?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How abruptly could I burn that trust for a quick buck?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just because we could doesn’t mean we should&lt;br /&gt;
Ask yourself: “how can I earn more trust today?”&lt;br /&gt;
It’s often as simple as showing up&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="business" /><summary type="html">Which sounds most painful?</summary></entry></feed>
