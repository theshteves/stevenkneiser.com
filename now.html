<!---
I love this place & it's definitely one of the most underrated urban centers in the Us (did I also mention affordable?), but that doesn't stop me from peaking for my personal ideal fitting my odd priorities. It's got almost everything, but the entire world is urbanizing & I'm keeping an eye out for exceptional satellite cities. I think remote work was largely overhyped because social media hasn't innovated enough to make online communities intimate enough. The worldwide web will ge tthere, but I believe very strongly we're not even in the Day 1 of the internet. 95% of "remote work" will recede because they don't have enough operational & cultural sophistication to support asynchronous work yet. The pandemic was an external force, but the shif tto remote work needs to be an internal suction because the tools are so good. They're great, but they're not there yet (e.g. Slack repulses the average employee way more than it pulls in with excitment). Once there are better online conference tools (I have no clue. It might take as much as mass adoption of more affordable next-gen augmented reality). Still on the search for the ideal city

Don't forget awesome partner & 2 cats

<p>I can recall the awe:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“So you’re saying…<br />if I knew just the right things to type,<br />I could build …ANYTHING??<br /><br />That with pure scribbles,<br />I’d build something very concrete<br />that would affect people?”</em><br />–me, before learning to code</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unreal. Pure magic. I could see it all right then &amp; there from the Quadratic Formula in Algerba II: <strong>coding is a real-life superpower</strong>. The thought of typing something into existence seemed no different from fictional wizards/sorcerers/magicians who chant cryptic words that actually summon strange things into existence. As children, we grasp for any sign that we are one-of-a-kind, that our story will be told like the others’ we’ve heard, that we alone might be the protagonist.</p>

<p>Santa Claus was no longer real, but at last I’d found a crack in my own reality. What castles in the sky would this superpower lift me to?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic”</em> –Arthur C. Clarke</p>
</blockquote>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But this is the “/now” page,
<br />not “/please-tell-me-your-sanitized-life-story”</p>

<!---
I started my coding journey before college & before I knew it was a well-paying career path (even though that helped me to commit long-term). If it were any other way, I wouldn't find myself constantly returning to it after time off.  Sure, it's something I enjoy, but it's always for a different purpose:

3 questions 

I got obsessed with distribution.

& now I'm back at  the begininning: great product is what matters. Turns out "distribution" is a double-edged sword: however good or bad your  product/service is, good distribution merely spreads the word faster. In this sense, poor distribution is an advantage because it gives you room to experiment & fail brutally without permanent reputational damage, even if I'm oversimplifying.

If my life were a video game, this is like I beat the game once  already, so I'm ready to come back to the first level.

<h2 id="reading-like-im-running-out-of-time">Reading like I’m running out of time</h2>

<p>To me,
<br />non-fiction &gt; &gt; fiction</p>

<p>…but recently I’ve grown sick of New Content™ about tech, business, &amp; self-help</p>

<p><strong>I’ve gotten obsessed with “old &amp; boring non-fiction”</strong>: history, philosophy, &amp; especially “The Classics” [of the Western Canon]. Don’t worry, I’m just as fascinated with Southeast Asia &amp; regions/narratives outside Europe.</p>

<p>In other words,
<br />I’m a STEM kid who finally “got” Liberal Arts</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><em>Where were these interests growing up?</em></p>

<p><strong>I now embrace Liberal Arts as both less AND more important</strong> than “Technical Arts” (e.g. software, UX design, digital marketing, etc). The Technical Arts are more important: young adults need that first taste of success when they practice the crafts of their time (crafts come &amp; go every generation, if not decade). They need a profitable flywheel if they want to fly outside their parents’ nest.</p>

<p>Why are these two arts
<br />even taught in the same years?</p>

<p>Yet the Technical Arts offer only an antidote to dependency &amp; individualism. What about engaging in the awe-inspiring world around us? One day–like it or not–we all must graduate to the stage of the Liberal Arts to join those timeless dialogues in a productive way.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I was wrong</p>

<p>I was wrong all along
<br />so consider this my love song:</p>

<p>Liberal Arts degrees are wasted on the young &amp; inexperienced who have nothing at stake. <strong>The Liberal Arts don’t belong in college degrees: they reach to the heights of one’s lifelong pursuit of wisdom.</strong> The arts are but an ever-evolving conversation that belies the burden of adulthood.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>There’s no escape
<br />There’s no graduation
<br />So join the conversation</p>

<p>Adults get pop quizzes too
<br />just with graver consequences</p>

<p>This is your only second chance
<br />Skip the reading at your own risk</p>

<h2 id="finally-exercising-again">Finally exercising again</h2>

<p><strong>January 2020</strong>: I’m in the best shape of my life since high school varsity sports. I’m weight training for the first time in my life (&amp; consistently at that). I’ve radically experimented with my diet &amp; I’m not even unfalsifiably opinionated or cult-like about my particular approach to nutrition. My blood lipids have remarkably reversed course &amp; I’m even underweight.</p>

<p><em>~ the-virus-that-shall-not-be-named knocks on the door ~</em></p>

<p><strong>January 2021</strong>: I’m in the worst shape of my life. Maybe I should ask my doctor abou– oh, those are just called stretch marks 🙃 …at least now I can cut my own hair! <em>If only I could do more than shave it off</em></p>

<p><strong>June 2021</strong>: Alright, no more worst-case prepping. I can start grabbing fresh ingredients twice weekly &amp; cooking again. Let’s try out the ultra-simple Ferriss-style:</p>

<ul>
  <li>meat &amp; veggies</li>
  <li>w/ a side of legumes &amp; kettlebell swings</li>
  <li>&amp; 1 <em>helluva’</em> glutinous cheat day per week</li>
</ul>

<!---
Before the pandemic, I had radically experimented with my nutrition over 2 years to evaporate my cholesterol problem & started weight training [freeweights of course] for the very first time in my life. After dialing in those habits, I consciously decided to halt everything in early February 2020 (even turned down 2 job offers! one after a FOUR HOUR phone negotiation where they made an exploitative offer that would've screwed me if the rumors about a pandemic were true & the other I actually accepting on condition that it was remote only for them to bait&switch me right before the start date) & optimize all of that to go complete survival mode &gotten into the best shape of my life post-pandemic. After a year of rationing on anything & everything that I can easily carry home that minimizes the number of trips I need to make to the grocery store, I've ballooned back to my all-time high weight. I don't know why it took me so long to recommit but as of last month I'm back on the horse & I feel [relatively] better about myself with each passing day

<p>That’s right:
<em>there’s more where this came from!</em></p>

<p>The more reading &amp; studying I do, the more I have to write &amp; share. I’ve gotten to an exciting point in my life where I’m developing more internally-consistent worldviews while mainting an openness to mystery &amp; wonder. The only thing I really know is that no one really knows.</p>

<p>Let’s build futures worth building</p>

<p>The funny thing is <strong>I’ve always <em>been</em> a researcher. I only recently made a habit of writing stuff down.</strong> It forces me to take these ideas more seriously. Why not share it with the people most invested in me?</p>

<!---
What makes it even cooler is expressing it isn't just for free. I get compounding returns to forcibly clarifying my thoughts much further than before. The act of recalling information actually reinforces it & expressing my thoughts nudges me towards consuming higher-quality ideas.

## [TODO: any other major GTD-style projects]

The.


* Living in the heart of downtown Indianapolis with an awesome partner
* self-studying entirely new interests in geography, world history, & jumping around the western canon (reconsidering a lot of worldviews after thinking outside the U.S., searching earnestly for lost ideas on technological progressinnovative cultures, lost ideas on technological progress, & tracking the symbiotic coevolution of humanity with technology)

How you can help:


* job searching
* building my case for tech optimism
* [note: keep these limited to GTD-style outcomes I'm reaching for]
* shipping daily updates to this cwc (+now this site)
* designing a better WFH lifestyle trying to make more internet friends outside the US (i.e. neglecting local relationships in favor of global ones [link sivers essay])
* finally strength training again for the first time since the pandemic (I've slowly ballooned up to college-grad weight & lack of shape RIGHT after the best shape & blood lipids of my life)
* [TODO: just do a GTD weekly review & that will inform this page]
-->

<!---
>  TODO: get nownownow backlink

* writing & shipping daily for >CWC (new-age "creator economy" small business some day in 5 years)

* REALLY enjoying remote work (especially as excuse to dail-in routine + nutrition + workouts)
* open & searching for work. I'm getting extremely excited about collaboration again, as I recently figured out I wasn't searching for "freedom from" but "freedom to"nimmerse myself more deeply with others (hey, [OnDeck](/why-ondeck))

...

* Living with my long-term girlfriend in downtown Indianapolis for the near-term & trying to discover my dream, long-term city [TODO: show candidates] ...I have a lurking suspicion that it will probably be a satellite city for remote work, even though global trends suggest that people are increasingly urbanizing

* Self-teaching more liberal arts (I've long been a die-hard STEM kid & I think it's the most practical. I both believe that STEM is one of the more important things to START learning with, so that you have a utilitarian/practical place to integrate yourself into the world, but as time passes: I both feel that Liberal Arts is both MORE & LESS important than STEM. Less in that it shouldn't really precede STEM ...ideally, I think a more optimal balance is to focus more purely on current capacities/technologies/etc earlier in education BEFORE you mature onto what is ultmately more important. I didn't have the stomach or capcity for history, social studies, philosophy before, but now I have a life with real-world objectives that shine context & make it immensely useful. So let me be clear: I've recently come to appreciate Liberal Arts as a higher goal, but only insofar as I have the capcity to concern mself with them. I think we've had a recent overproduction of liberal arts education as evidenced by all the recent grads that  don't find themselves a good place to start in the world. Liberal arts isn't given, it's earned. In short, I've come to understand that logic isn't a strict subset of math. They are seperate neterprises & most of this is the necesary move from studying the world of the deductive to the world of the inductive.) ... in theory if I were to raise kids today, I would STEM them to heck for the first 20 years so they're super effective operators in the world, then graudate them onto the higher, ongoing never-ending conversations of Liberal Arts, but now rooted in real-world urgency & NEVER letting their eyes of the dashboard controls & immediacy of life.)
