I studied engineering because I loved problem-solving  
But the job market is unforgiving for academics  
People speak from different languages & concerns

College tests were consistent, built on an agreed-upon knowledge base  
If none of my peers understood a problem, we'd curse the professor  

These norms help researchers push the frontier of human knowledge  
But most problems aren't at the fringes of science; they're between people  
Newton figured out Calculus long ago, but billions are still unable to  
The range of business problems dwarfs that of engineering

Good engineers, consultants, & salespeople are skilled at finding solutions  
But what makes one great is an ability to find a better problem  
To not solve what emerges, but what brought it up  
They aren't paid to answer, but to further question

## Problem-solving isn't about the solution

> "What's the answer?"

Problems with enough definition are already solved  
Profound solutions aren't "outside the box"  
They come when you poke around each line to reveal the circle

We've already solved smaller problems  
We even solved solving with computers  
Stop grinding your gears when we have machines  
The most worthwhile question is one you haven't asked yet
