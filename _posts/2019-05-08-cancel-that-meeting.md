Does someone disrespect our time?  
We decide whether their excuse will suffice

When our clothes are dirty, should we let bacteria run its course  
or put in the 5 minutes to get the soap bath going?

Overexposure blinds us to smell  
Tension in our relationships _can_ air out but we both deserve better

## Who are we ignoring?

If our biggest client/friend demands 80% of our time, fire them  
Cancel that meeting: someoneâ€™s waiting on the other line
