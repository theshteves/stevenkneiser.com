A home is different from a house  
A house is a general-purpose shelter  
A home is a feeling of shelter: belonging & gratitude

And a day home is different from a night home  
A home during the day offers community, opportunity, & a launchpad  
A home during the night secures restraint, recovery, & reflection

The night is for listening, not day talk

## Your night, your armor

When we resist the night: we work too late  
and we quarrel & quibble & squabble with family  
Kicking or screaming, the night engulfs flame  
It forces us into remission: fatigue, followed by sickness

What does your night need for a better day?  
You need others, but that is for day  
Tonight needn't be another fight
