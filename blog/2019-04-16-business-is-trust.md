Which sounds most intimidating?

* applying for jobs out of reach
* asking that stranger on a date
* building a sustainable business

<!-- excerpt -->

These are transactions, and they require communication  
If you want someone else's time or money,  
then you need to earn their trust 

> **Trust is a communication cache: when we trust, we needn't say another word**

In love, trust brings comfort & security  
In business, trust brings money & success

## Do I know you?

Your career in your 20s is largely stockpiling social proof  
When an employer asks for your portfolio, they need social proof  
They only _trust_ some of the employers who've _entrusted_ you before

> Does Bill Gates need a résumé?

Most people start dating through a social circle  
You can "go out" but what if some cutie already hangs out with your friends?  
They already _trust_ you because enough people _they trust_ do

This is why building my first business alone was so. damn. hard.  
People only buy when they _trust_ me to solve their problem  
**Nothing matters** until I can prove it to them in their own language

* How long did I take to build that trust?
* How abruptly could I burn that trust for a quick buck?

Just because you could doesn't mean you should  
Ask yourself: "how can I earn more trust today?"  
It's often as simple as showing up
