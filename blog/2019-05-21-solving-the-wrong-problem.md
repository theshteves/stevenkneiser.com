<!-- excerpt -->
<br />

I studied engineering because I loved "problem-solving"  
But problems come from many domains & languages

**Markets rarely reward purists**

College tests were consistent, built on an agreed-upon knowledge base  
If none of my peers understood a problem, we'd curse the professor  
That culture helped us push the frontier of human knowledge, but 

**Most problems aren't at the edges of science; they're between people**

Newton figured out Calculus long ago, but _billions_ still can't  
The range of business problems dwarfs that of academia

<br />

_Good_ engineers, consultants, & salespeople find solutions  
but _Great_ ones find deeper problems  
They don't solve what emerged,  
but what brought it up  

**Professionals aren't paid to answer,  
but to further question**

So what's the answer?  
.  
.  
.  
Wrong question

## It isn't about solving

It's about starting a new relationship  
It's about _getting to know_ the problem

A problem well-defined is already solved

**Profound solutions aren't "outside the box":  
they come when you ask enough questions  
to notice that "the box" was just a circle**

<br />

The most difficult problems I face  
have multiple tempting half-solutions  
that only distract from the pursuit of clarity

We've already solved the small problems  
We even solved solving with machines  
so stop grinding your gears

**The most worthwhile question  
is the one you haven't asked yet**

_The very best even ask computers questions_
