_If only it were so easy_

<!-- excerpt -->
<br />


I studied engineering because I loved problem-solving  
But the job market is unforgiving for academics  
People speak from different languages & concerns

College tests were consistent, built on an agreed-upon knowledge base  
If none of my peers understood a problem, we'd curse the professor  

These norms help researchers push the frontier of human knowledge  
But most problems aren't at the fringes of science; they're between people  
**Newton figured out Calculus long ago, but billions are still unable to  
The range of business problems dwarfs that of engineering**

_Good_ engineers, consultants, & salespeople are skilled at finding solutions  
But what makes one _great_ is an ability to find a better problem  
To not solve what emerges, but what brought it up  
They aren't paid to answer, but to further question

## Problem-solving isn't about the solution

> "What's the answer?"

Problems with enough definition are already solved  

**Profound solutions aren't "outside the box"  
They come when you realize "the box" is actually a circle**

We've already solved smaller problems  
We even solved solving with computers  
Stop grinding your gears when we have machines  
The most worthwhile question is one you haven't asked yet
