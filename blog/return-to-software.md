I can recall the awe:

> _"So you're saying...<br />if I knew just the right things to type,<br />I could build ...ANYTHING??<br /><br />That with pure scribbles,<br />I'd build something very concrete<br />that would affect people?"_<br />--me, before learning to code

Unreal. Pure magic. I could see it all right then & there from the Quadratic Formula in Algerba II: **coding is a real-life superpower**. The thought of typing something into existence seemed no different from fictional wizards/sorcerers/magicians who chant cryptic words that actually summon strange things into existence. As children, we grasp for any sign that we are one-of-a-kind, that our story will be told like the others' we've heard, that we alone might be the protagonist.

Santa Claus was no longer real, but at last I'd found a crack in my own reality. What castles in the sky would this superpower lift me to?

Sorry, this is about "/now",
<br />not "/please-tell-me-your-sanitized-life-story"

So what's the point?

When I  finished college, I wasn't the average Computer Science student who just showed up to classes & took my tests. I did every single thing I could outside of the classroom to master my craft. I went to dozens of  conferences, I'd shipped products, I'd collaborated with skilled artists & designers, I'd coordinated teams, & I even worked at a big tech company (not once, but twice).

**Personally, I didn't stumble out of college with a degree, but a formidable 3 years of product management experience** (especially in rapid prototyping)

**But I had enough**: I had already climbed the mountain I came to climb

I didn't need to "start my career"
<br />**I was ready for the next chapter**

<br />

When you run out of role models,
<br />you need new blueprints

But where else to look?

I now had enough tools in my toolbelt, that technical competence wasn't my bottleneck any more. I wasn't the type to just sit down & cash in on those skills for the next decade. I wanted more. **I wanted to understand "the Businessâ„¢ side".** I wanted to build companies of own so that I could employ all my friends & build the software we saw in the world

...but I had 1 nagging, existential question:

> "_even if_ I could build anything I wanted<br /><br />_even if_ I could get better at managing a larger team to build quicker<br /><br />**what did that matter ...if I couldn't figure out _which_ problems were _most worth_ solving?**"

**I needed perspective<br />& from _outside_ my domain of expertise**

* TODO: elaborate

...

I've always loved software, but I'm big on communication: I want to relate to others outside software. I'm a craftsperson who loves to chat just as much with marketers & salespeople about their craft. My high school tagline was "always ready to pull back the curtain & study the clockwork" & that's never changed.

I invested a few years to better understand "business" & the entire revenue-side of organizations. But I never intended to leave my background behind. It's true that the half-life of technical knowledge is shortening, so I want to re-engage with the craft of software as long as I can keep up.

**So I might be a little rusty,
<br />but I'm back**
<br/>& this time I know where I want to go

* TODO: more to come

* TODO: this justifies its own essay. Extract this into an isolated essay to link to

I started my coding journey before college & before I knew it was a well-paying career path (even though that helped me to commit long-term). If it were any other way, I wouldn't find myself constantly returning to it after time off.  Sure, it's something I enjoy, but it's always for a different purpose:

3 questions 

I got obsessed with distribution.

& now I'm back at  the begininning: great product is what matters. Turns out "distribution" is a double-edged sword: however good or bad your  product/service is, good distribution merely spreads the word faster. In this sense, poor distribution is an advantage because it gives you room to experiment & fail brutally without permanent reputational damage, even if I'm oversimplifying.

If my life were a video game, this is like I beat the game once  already, so I'm ready to come back to the first level.
