This list continues to evolve today & I'll continue to fight the temptation to bloat it over time. I may post other best-of's individually, but this is the home for my consistent top performers. I have a recency bias where I write about my most recent obsessions, but **this is a permanent home for sticky ideas that have withstood the test of [my] time**

...& my attention-span

On final review, this list is more US-centric than I'd prefer, so I encourage people to check out this [world map of the world by population](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram) & this [animated world map of twitter activity over one month (2013)](https://vimeo.com/347801005). The internet isn't just your country. This map gives you a better feel for who you'll be interacting with in the future.
