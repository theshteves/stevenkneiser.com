Ted Talks‚Ñ¢
<br />are for Ideas Worth Spreading

This list
<br />is for Links Worth Spreading

<!-- excerpt -->
<br />


This list continues to evolve today & I still fight the temptation to bloat it over time. I publish smaller best-of's, but **this is a permanent home for my most shared links.** There's enough recency bias on the worldwide web. These ideas have withstood the test of [my] time (...& attention-span).

> NOTE: despite my best efforts, this list ended up more US-centric than I'd prefer. Check out this [world map scaled by population](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram) & this [animated world map of twitter activity over one month (2013)](https://vimeo.com/347801005) _...only one channel & in 2013!_
> 
> **The internet isn't just your country**. Really, it's become one of its own. Those links will give you a better feel for your fellow citizens of the web. You'll bump into more of us each year.

### [How aging will kill you <br /> & what you can do about that](https://youtu.be/vDFxdkck354?t=478)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vDFxdkck354?start=478" title="Peter Attia - Reverse engineered approach to human longevity" loading="lazy" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Don't worry, there's no strong-arm philosophy/product/pitch at the end here: just a survey of some exploratory research. This isn't a short-sweet tactical summary, but rather an interesting strategy that might make you reconsider your approach.

Here's Peter, both an engineer & accomplished medical doctor, speaking to a room
of medical researchers so don't expect to follow every detail of this
discussion. This is a great summary of some of the best current thinking on how to
not let aging sneak up on you so much.

Seeing an ordered list of aging-related disease based on likelihood really
reframed how I think about taking care of my body. There's a "longevity Olympics" that you have decades to train for & it looks nothing like
training for the normal Olympics. You might not even aspire to live much longer than average, but you can start thinking about how to live better in the coming decades.

> **_"The key to living longer [for now] is delaying the onset of chronic disease"_**

<br /><br />


### [Improve your air quality](https://dynomight.net/air/)

A data-driven rant on why you should care about air quality & a supplementary guide for a cheap DIY air purifier that totally gets the job done

In an urbanizing world,
<br />sensitivity to air pollution both outdoors & indoors will probably continue to grow more relevant

_I promptly chucked my ultrasonic humidifier out the window after reading this_

<br /><br />


### [You don't have to be local](https://sive.rs/local)

This simple thought-piece tapped me at the right time: it gave me
permission. This realization is slowly dawning on people all over the world.
The more friends you make in different countries/timezones, the more people move closer to major urban hubs (especially ones far away from you), the more you **question how you distribute your time locally vs globally**.

The automobile reshaped America when it shrunk the time-distance between the opportunities of the city to further stretches of land (now suburbs). The internet shrinks that distance between you & everyone else down to within your room. **There are entire semi-public conferences going on as we speak all around you in this City in the Sky.** Perhaps you should network a little more around these Shops in the Sky?

<br />

**How would you approach the world differently if that window of opportunity was closing?** Thought experiment: if the internet as you knew it today only had another 10 years before fracturing, imploding, or getting monopolized by AI, would you reconsider your approach to this once in a planetary history opportunity?

**Your favorite friends, artists, & partners in the whole literal world are at last reachable** up there. Is it not worth a few extra years searching? Distance is no longer an excuse. I just didn't realize I even had a choice.

<br /><br />


### [r/PersonalFinance flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)

> _(Specific to the U.S.)_

The art of investing is the art of decision-making. Every decision you make is a vote for the person you'll become. **This is the lazy-yet-informed approach to maximize your returns _relative to your risk & effort_**. Recall that tired 80/20 saying about "the 20% of efforts that will yield you 80% of the results"?

In my experience,
<br />you'll take this 1 of 2 ways
<br />(assuming this is new to you):

Some people are so ecstatic that they binge this kinda stuff for months, but
others...<br />let's just say<br />_it's not their idea of fun_

<br />

If you're already intimidated or overwhelmed at the mere idea of counting up all the bills on your counter or fees in your accounts, you're probably suffering from a backwards case of "grass is greener". Ignorance is not bliss & you know it: it eats away at you from the inside until you're a hollow shell of your former self. Getting clear on "your finances" is the only antidote to stress, the only therapy of its kind. **For some of you, thinking about money is like eating broken glass & staring into the abyss**, when it's actually more like roping off a crime scene & getting the victims the answers they deserve.

You may think you have nothing, that you're doomed, but a quick google search will find you many stories of people that have gotten out of significantly more dire financial circumstances. Just because you have 40k/80k/120k in student loan debt & several thousand in credit card debt is far from the end of the world.

**The grass really is greener on the other side**

<br />

I recently wrote about ["Whose Ladder Are You Climbing?"](https://creatorswhocode.com/blog/whose-ladder) when it dawned on me that **many "career ladders" felt more like spider webs of someone else's design** to tie me up & bite my head off. Without getting to know you, I'd consider this one of the few ladders worth investing the time to climb. What matters is that it's a climb _of your own design_.

Best of all, the top of whatever ladder you choose it is probably _way_ lower than you think! You almost certainly don't need to park your dreams behind some arbitrary "ermm, 3 million??" number [assuming no  extreme inflation]. I've met people that said with a straight face that they'd need a couple billion to do what they "really" want to do. Don't be this person. There are probably opportunities to get 60% of the experience for 1% of the cost. This corner case was precisely the reason Tim Ferriss wrote the scammy-sounding-by-design-but-100%-legit-&-game-changing book "The 4-Hour Workweek" (you could probably preview the first 2 chapters on Amazon for free if you're that curious)

> _"How come there's no 'life essentials' class in high school??? I wish
> someone had taught me earlier about budgeting, taxes, how to change a tire, etc<br />...ya'know, the \~AcTuAlLy ImPoRtAnT sTuFf\~, not math with letters"_
> <br />--every American has this uncle

The flowchart I linked is your stable foundation. This isn't the be-all end-all on the art of investing for people who've entirely escaped the game of money, but this could be a more sustainable path _to get you there_.

<br />

What if you're a trigger-happy capitalist who wants to YOLO more than 1% of your net worth into speculative investments? Hey, live your life. BUT **if you don't at least understand these fundamentals in & out, you haven't earned the right**

> _"Rule #1: never lose money<br />Rule #2: never forget rule #1"_<br />--Warren Buffett

> _"A fool & his money are soon parted"_<br />--[proverb]

<br />

That's my plea
<br />& I hope you'll thank me
<br />for not burying it further down

_P.S. Your parents called üìû<br />they want to know when you're finally going to get a haircut & a "real" job_

Their words, not mine

> **Disclosure:<br />because I value integrity:** <br />I'm not a "Fiduciary Financial Advisor" (nor am I a Medical Doctor), & I don't play one on the internet. This is strictly for informational purposes only. I've placed a high-level of trust & confidence in your critical-thinking abilities to decide on the best course of action for you. There will always be rare windows of opportunity to completely disregard all conventional advice (& many many many more scams misleading you with the fantasy of getting rich quick). My hope is that this perspective/philosophy/approach simply provides a useful comparison to other financial ideas you might consider over your lifetime.


<br /><br />


### [2 decades of inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease)

> _(Specific to the U.S.)_

Like many things,
<br />you might not take an interest in economics
<br />but economics certainly takes an interest in you!

This single graph explains so much of the current economy around us [in the U.S.]. **In the last 20 years, what goods & services have become relatively more costly & by how much?**

You may be familiar
<br />with _the general idea_ of inflation
<br />& how $80 was _"actually a pretty big deal"_ in 1910,

but not every dollar is equal [in the way you thought],
<br />so let's peak behind that curtain _...by sector_

<img class="mx-auto" src="/img/2-decades-of-inflation.webp" alt="U.S. Price Changes (2000 to 2020)" />

Worth noting "average hourly wages"
<br />isn't the same as _median_ hourly wages,
<br />since ~1971 there's been a
<br />...rather controversial divide

**Take a good long look at this graph**

These are the waters you might not have realized you're swimming in. Outside of the "he said : she said" noise of day-to-day politics, this is the playing field that tells 80% of the story. We're all processors in the same societal super-computer grinding our gears towards better solutions to this problem.

<br /><br />


### [All you need is 10](https://seths.blog/2009/04/first-ten/)

> _"but Global‚Ñ¢ this!
> <br />Macroeconomic‚Ñ¢ that
> <br />Geopolitical‚Ñ¢ these!"_

Good news! You can start in the calm of your small world.

This is staying out of the storm. **This is soothing wisdom from & for the age of distraction**. With today's absurd marketing potential via the Internet, there's this seductive incentive to just try to extract a tiny value out of lots of people, even millions (e.g. living comfortably on YouTube Ad revenue from millions of views, living comfortably on App Store revenue from millions of $.49 downloads).

> _"Just because you can doesn't mean you should"_

It's never that easy & it's the least rewarding. Don't try to skip the line by providing pennies of value to some. Find ways to provide immense value to the very few around you that you can. This is less about top-down spray-and-pray, but rather bottoms-up building your capacity to chew on bigger problems.

<br />

Seth is a master of moderation
<br />with a focus on generosity
<br />who inspires by example

He doesn't "try to change the world"
<br />He just shows up every day

After 5 years of consuming every thoughtpiece that gives the faintest smell of entrepreneurship, this is my #2. Only #2 because what it lacks in length & detail is made up for in density & a meditative simplicity. Unlike the others, this is the most timeless. It will never go out of style. It doesn't have any prerequisites. It doesn't even give you permission to procrastinate by reading another follow-up article.

First, 10.
<br />& they'll take it from there
<br />but only once your stuff is good enough

When is it good enough?

When you can stop pushing
<br />because they've started pulling
<br />because they like you _that much_

<br />

**Create for 10, not 10,000**

First, 10.
<br />& they'll take it from there
<br />but only once your stuff is good enough

Don't try to skip ahead in line:
you could scale to 10,000 casual fans
but start by WOW'ing just 10 before you bother

By virtue of your work ethic,
you just might stumble on the right idea

BONUS: study his writing for a masterclass in simplicity (this blurb was much longer than his average post)

<br /><br />


### [Small Business 2.0 Revolution](https://stackingthebricks.com/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first/)

If [First, 10](#all-you-need-is-10) was my #2 favorite "entrepreneurship" read, then what could possibly be #1?

Where that previous one stands the test of time, this one makes up for in relevance & specificity ...even though this window of opportunity has a little more of a time limit.

<br />

Looking back now, this essay had a profound effect on my career. It even thematically fits the layered meaning behind the name of my other blog, [Creators Who Code](https://creatorswhocode.com). Why? Because the best coders _know when NOT to code_. They should instead view themselves as more general creators who only code ...when it finally come to that.

Oh, you know how to code?

Good for you. Don't become a hammer that starts look at everything as if it were a nail. The biggest downside to software is often the release time especially for the first iteration.

<br>

Another huge takeaway that I completely forgot hit me from this: I did a complete 180 on my lifelong distaste for writing. My writing wasn't actually all that bad, but gosh was it like pulling teeth every time & always over-budget. I'm being way too harsh on my pre-adult writing, but I didn't enjoy it _until stirring on this essay_: writing done right can provide 95% of the value‚Ñ¢ of software for 5% of the time investment! **Writing has a significantly shorter product iteration speed**, if not the shortest. Why start with software when I can churn out multiple written product tests in a day & see what sticks?

<br /><br />


### [Theory of Constraints](https://fortelabs.co/blog/theory-of-constraints-101/)

This is an entire series of essays on a hidden gem of the manufacturing industry. People around me today in software probably don't know that "Agile" & agile methodologies are little more than a paint-job over this more timeless idea from a much less sexy industry (which is one reason they dressed it up in new clothes)

* TODO: elaborate (also Lindy Effect breakdown)

If you're interested in project management, make sure not to skim over any sentences. This paradigm-shift is all about the subtle nuances. The power behind this ultra-deceptively simple forced me to rethink how I approach any project of formidable scale. The biggest diamond hidden in plain sight is when you don't try to apply this to entire organizations, but even on the scale of how you approach your work as an individual.

<br /><br />


### [Everything Is A Remix‚Ñ¢](https://www.everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series)

Being original is overrated
<br />nor is it really realistic

> _"Good artists copy. Great artists steal."_

They've continued the project,
but I'm referring to the original 2015 version:

<br /><br />


### [A case for optimism](https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world)

Social media algorithms benefit from a negativity bias, but is the world really getting worse?

Don't lose the forest for the trees

We certainly have no shortage of work left to do, but **"knowledge about what we have achieved leaves no place for cynicism"**. Our World in Data‚Ñ¢ is a goldmine of empirical data. I linked the one I did because it felt most relevant but I encourage you to filter their articles for other topics you're interested in! I'll drop one more relevant link for [their longer compilation of data on Optimism & Pessimism](https://ourworldindata.org/optimism-pessimism).

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-in-poverty-relative-to-different-poverty-thresholds?time=earliest..2017&country=~OWID_WRL" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>


<br /><br />


### [How Software Is Eating The World](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1)

Let me be clear, this is a book-length collection of essays elaborating on the ideas of someone who invented the original, graphical web browser & has gone on to run one of the most successful venture capital firms funding countless software companies who lay the landscape for the world you live in today. While the lead writer may drop more SAT words than you've seen in a while, this is a masterful summary of how _...software is eating the world._

For all you "non-technical" folks who don't have Computer Science degrees, I'd commit to whichever 3-5 chapters most grab your interest. You've heard "transformational technology" enough times to question "really? When I look back in history, I don't see any comparison of this much sustaining innovation. Is this all just hype propping up a failing system? How far can this revolution _really_ go?" ...this might be the most thorough introduction to open your eyes.

<br /><br />


### [A Singaporean perspective on US-China relations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1AY9H89tTY)

This provocative talk is a masterclass in persuasion. Don't let the title deceive you: this ice-breaker comes from a place of deep cultural investment & admiration in Western Philosophy.

...& more importantly, from a well-connected UN ambassador on the other side of the world. If you weren't aware, the country of Singapore is a brilliant city-state that administers by some measures the busiest port in the world. For their size, they could not be more deeply embedded in the global network of trade, which gives them a unique outsider-yet-insider perspective on India, China, & the U.S. to name a few.

This is a cold shower
<br />This is a wake-up call

Regardless of your sentiment towards "The West" (which is much more than the U.S. by the way), you don't have to be a complete doomer to benefit from the inquiry:

> _"How might we, the world,<br/>best prepare for a future where the U.S.<br />is no longer the undisputed hegemon?"_

If that sounds absurd,
<br />I encourage you to revisit
<br />the [world map scaled by population](https://ourworldindata.org/world-population-cartogram)
<br />at the very introduction of this page

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1AY9H89tTY?start=204" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's a crucial conversation<br />because it just doesn't divide cleanly into the "No, we're the worst." "No, we're the best." culture wars & narratives inside the U.S.

The other 95.75% of the world
<br />have their own narratives
<br />(not to mention our descendants)

<br /><br />

### [Against Waldenponding](https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/against-waldenponding)

When's the last time you've heard this:

> _"Ugh, we just need to disconnect more & get away from it all"_

...it's one thing to savor the time you get to be around friends & family, but perhaps the fantasies of taking months at a time away from society aren't what they're cracked up to be. I love this stuff so much because I've never heard this counter-argument: it makes me feel equally more & less at peace with the world today. That's a paradox I love to lean into.

### Hard-earned lessons in Environmentalism

> Coming Soon: rethinking Green‚Ñ¢ & notes on ecopragmatism from a lifetime

* Ecomodernism
* Ecopragmatism

Nothing unites people like a common enemy. What if there was more than just another person or group to scapegoat?

<!---
### [Hard-earned lessons in Environmentalism](https://e360.yale.edu/features/stewart_brands_strange_trip_whole_earth_to_nuclear_power)

Although even millenials might not recognize his name, Stewart Brand [TODO]. He now prefers the term eco-pragmatist. We can't go back & we can't afford to slow innnnovations on the horizon. Even if you're a proud tree-hugger who thinks that _"industrial civilization has committed crimes, sins against nature, and retribution is coming"_ ...then he's a respectful, sympathetic voice who learned some hard lessons.

We all have something to learn from someone who has been on the frontier of the environmental movement since the '60s & '70s. This is the only exception to my rule for this page because the exact link to him isn't as important as his perspective that has loomed over me.  There may be better summaries, but this short interview is a brief enough introduction to his current thinking.
