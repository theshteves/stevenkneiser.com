To me,
<br /> non-fiction >> fiction

…but recently I’ve grown sick of New Content™ about tech, business, & self-help

<!-- excerpt -->
<br />

**I’ve gotten obsessed with “old & boring non-fiction”**: history, philosophy, & especially “The Classics [of Western Thought]". Don't worry, I'm just as fascinated with regions & narratives that aren't north of the Mediterranean Sea.

In other words,
<br />I’m a STEM kid who finally “got” Liberal Arts

<br />

_Where were these interests growing up?_

**I now embrace The Liberal Arts™ as both less AND more important** than "The Technical Arts" (e.g. software, UX design, digital marketing, etc). The Technical Arts are more urgent: young adults can build independence when they engage with the industries & crafts of their time. There's only one problem: crafts evolve faster every generation (especially since the Industrial Revolution).

Why are these two arts
<br />even discussed in the same sentence?
<br />even discussed in the same institutions?

Sure, The Technical Arts offer an antidote to dependency, but what about engaging in the awe-inspiring world around us, with people nothing like us? One day&mdash;like it or not&mdash;**we all must graduate to the stage of The Liberal Arts, if we want to contribute to these timeless & borderless dialogues.** You don't _have_ to. You don't even have to contribute _productively_. But **if you want to be heard at the innovative, future-frothing fringes of industry, you don't have a choice.**

<br />

I was wrong

I was wrong all along
<br />so consider this my love song:

Liberal Arts degrees are often wasted on the young & inexperienced who have nothing at stake. **The Liberal Arts don't belong baked behind college degrees: they are the products powering the heights of humanity's collective computation.** The Liberal Arts are but an ever-evolving conversation that belies the burden of adulthood.

You're in this for life, literally

<br />

There’s no escape
<br />There’s no graduation
<br />So join the conversation

Adults get pop quizzes too
<br />just with graver consequences

This is your only second chance
<br />Skip the reading at your own risk

<br />

_...you ARE reading this time, right?_
