To me,
<br />non-fiction >> fiction

…but recently I’ve grown sick of New Content™ about tech, business, & self-help

<!-- excerpt -->
<br />

**I’ve gotten obsessed with “old & boring non-fiction”**: history, philosophy, & especially “The Classics [of Western Thought]". Don't worry, I'm just as fascinated with regions & narratives that aren't north of the Mediterranean Sea.

In other words,
<br />I’m a STEM kid who finally “got” Liberal Arts

<br />

_Where were these interests growing up?_

**I now embrace Liberal Arts as both less AND more important** than "Technical Arts" (e.g. software, UX design, digital marketing, etc). The Technical Arts are more important: young adults need that first taste of success that comes from engaging with the crafts of their time. The only problem is that crafts have come & gone every generation since the Industrial Revolution. That's a good problem to have.

Why are these two arts
<br />even taught in the same years?

Sure, the Technical Arts offer an antidote to dependency, but what about engaging in the awe-inspiring world around us, with people nothing like us? One day--like it or not--we all must graduate to the stage of the Liberal Arts to join those timeless & borderless dialogues (at least productively).

<br />

I was wrong

I was wrong all along
<br />so consider this my love song:

Liberal Arts degrees are often wasted on the young & inexperienced who have nothing at stake. **The Liberal Arts don't belong solely behind college degrees: they reach to the heights of one’s lifelong pursuit of wisdom.** The arts are but an ever-evolving conversation that belies the burden of adulthood.

<br />

There’s no escape
<br />There’s no graduation
<br />So join the conversation

Adults get pop quizzes too
<br />just with graver consequences

This is your only second chance
<br />Skip the reading at your own risk

<br />

_...you ARE reading this time, right?_
