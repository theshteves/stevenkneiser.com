## Living in Indianapolis

_...in the heart of downtown<br />with an awesome partner & 2 cats_

> _"With $7 billion in tech company acquisitions and IPOs, **the most affordable housing market in the country, and a high production of software jobs**, Indianapolis (and Indiana as a whole) is uniquely positioned to grow."_
> 
> -- [TechPoint](https://techpoint.org/)

They're who put the city on my radar

## Returning to software

<br />

I never _left_ but...
<br />after college, **I took a career gambit**

I could've climbed comfortably-compensated careers, but come graduation: I couldn't write cover letters

With the tools to tackle many problems,
<br />I wanted to take the time
<br />to take it all in:

> **"what problems are most _worth_ solving?"**

Little did I know
<br />how far that would go

<br />

<br />I started diversifying my skillset:

* small business fundamentals
* software sales (B2B SaaS)
* digital marketing & SEO
* even blogging

& with that came much more perspective:
<br />**I see the bigger picture of "product"<br />much more clearly now**

Let's build futures worth seeing

I'm back
<br />& I'm codin' again
<br />_but this time it's different..._

## Reading like I'm running out of time

* Geography
* World History
* History of Science
* Economics (& how it's been reborn)
* The messy nature of technological progress

🔓 unlocked: a newfound patience & depth of curiosity about the world around us.

Apparently I've been writing like I'm running out of time too. This was succinct, but just a tad too long & distracting for this page:

## Writing daily for CreatorsWhoCode.com

I contribute to a blog, newsletter, & community
<br />that helps new developers 💃🕺 𝕊𝕋𝔸ℕ𝔻 𝕆𝕌𝕋

Over 500 days later,
<br />I'm still showing up every day
<br />to ship something new on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ACCOUNTABILITY THREAD:<br>I will ship every day<br><br>Yesterday, I turned 24 🎉<br>Last year: immense growth, but private<br>This year: working &amp; learning in public</p>&mdash; Steven Kneiser 👨🏼‍🍳 (@theshteves) <a href="https://twitter.com/theshteves/status/1277811840274358272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2020</a></blockquote>

## Launched personal site (& newsletter)!

_There's more where this came from!_

But why?

My social network is increasingly global & I need a stable [digital] home to keep contact with you all. **My weekly newsletter is for anyone who wants to keep in-touch with me**, even when we can't justify a conversation every week or month.

_The social accountability is a nice plus too_

<br />

I only recently made a habit of writing stuff down

The more reading & studying I do, the more I have to write & share. It turns out that _I've always been_ a researcher, just without realizing it. It forces me to take my ideas more seriously & hold myself to a higher standard of rigor. **Why not share that with those most invested in me?**

## Finally exercising again 

**January 2020**: I'm in the best shape of my life since high school varsity sports. I'm weight training for the first time ever (& consistently at that). I've radically experimented with my diet & I'm not even unfalsifiably opinionated or cult-like about my particular approach to nutrition. My blood lipids have remarkably reversed course & I'm ...underweight?

_~ the-virus-that-shall-not-be-named knocks on the door ~_

**January 2021**: I'm in the worst shape of my life. Maybe I should ask my doctor abou&mdash; oh, those are just called stretch marks 😩

<br />

**June 2021**: Alright, no more worst-case prepping. I can stop sprinting pre-planned routes through grocery stores & leaf through fresh ingredients to cook again. Let's return to the ultra-simple Ferriss-style:

* protein, non-starch veggies, _& lots of legumes!_
* w/ a side of kettlebell swings (5 minutes, 2x weekly)
* & 1 _anything_-goes cheat day of gluttony per week <br />(wait what? Yeah, the metabolic variance is actually productive)<br />..._mostly_ productive 😉

I'm already feeling like myself again

<br />

**December 2021 update:** I've never had my diet so dialed in! **I shed a consistent ~5.5 pounds monthly** until I reached my true form (that includes going out of my way most Saturdays to gain lots of water weight eating my vices in excess). Those improvements came almost exclusively from cleaning up my nutrition. Now I'm very slowly dialing up the cardio & weight training to compensate for my sedentary work life 👨‍💻

<br /><br />


## Let's hop on the phone!

_Since only the smartest, funniest, & most attractive readers such as yourself read this far..._ my calendar is particularly open for the next few months if you love chatting on the phone or Zoom. You can [schedule time directly into my calendar to chat](https://calendly.com/kneiser/30min) <span class="line-through">if you click/tap on my picture in the bottom left</span>! We'll see how long I can keep that up. I look forward to meeting you!
