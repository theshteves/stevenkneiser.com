## Living in Indianapolis

_in the heart of downtown<br />with an awesome partner & 2 cats_

> _"With $7 billion in tech company acquisitions and IPOs, **the most affordable housing market in the country, and a high production of software jobs**, Indianapolis (and Indiana as a whole) is uniquely positioned to grow."_

I love this place & it's definitely one of the most underrated urban centers in the Us (did I also mention affordable?), but that doesn't stop me from peaking for my personal ideal fitting my odd priorities. It's got almost everything, but the entire world is urbanizing & I'm keeping an eye out for exceptional satellite cities. I think remote work was largely overhyped because social media hasn't innovated enough to make online communities intimate enough. The worldwide web will ge tthere, but I believe very strongly we're not even in the Day 1 of the internet. 95% of "remote work" will recede because they don't have enough operational & cultural sophistication to support asynchronous work yet. The pandemic was an external force, but the shif tto remote work needs to be an internal suction because the tools are so good. They're great, but they're not there yet (e.g. Slack repulses the average employee way more than it pulls in with excitment). Once there are better online conference tools (I have no clue. It might take as much as mass adoption of more affordable next-gen augmented reality). Still on the search for the ideal city

Don't forget awesome partner & 2 cats

## Returning to software

This update blossomed into an entire essay:

<figure class='flex my-8 text-xl bg-gradient-to-bl from-yellow-50 via-yellow-50 to-yellow-300 w-max p-4 rounded items-center'>
  <div class='px-4'>👨‍💻 </div>
  <a href='/blog/return-to-software'>My return to software</a>

<br />

Here's how it's going:

[<img height="418" src='/github-contrib-year.webp' alt='GitHub contribution graph' />](https://github.com/theshteves)

For non-technical readers [on a phone],
<br />this is an instantly-recognizable
<br />GitHub "contribution graph":
<br />it hints at how frequently
<br />I shipped code last year
<br />(almost daily)

> _**Disclosure:<br />because I value integrity:**<br />...& I just like disclosures:<br />I was the developer of an open-source bot many many years ago that's gained some popularity over time to manipulate this contribution graph, but the effect was less than [a fifth?] of my output last year._
> 
> _I even held myself publicly accountable, replying every single day to [one long Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/theshteves/status/1277811840274358272) with what I shipped for that day (so even written contributions to another blog show up here). That streak is still going unbroken._
> 
> _In other words, the bot's contributions aren't even filling out any down-periods [as they usually do]. The only visible down-periods in the first place come from days I shipped updates in advance or after midnight._

## Reading like I'm running out of time

Apparently I've been writing like I'm running out of time too. This was succinct but just a tad too long & distracting for this page:

## Finally exercising again 

**January 2020**: I'm in the best shape of my life since high school varsity sports. I'm weight training for the first time in my life (& consistently at that). I've radically experimented with my diet & I'm not even unfalsifiably opinionated or cult-like about my particular approach to nutrition. My blood lipids have remarkably reversed course & I'm ...underweight?

_~ the-virus-that-shall-not-be-named knocks on the door ~_

**January 2021**: I'm in the worst shape of my life. Maybe I should ask my doctor abou-- oh, those are just called stretch marks 😩

**June 2021**: Alright, no more worst-case prepping. I don't need to efficiently speedrun grocery stores twice monthly anymore. I can start patiently grabbing fresh ingredients twice weekly & cooking again. Let's return to the ultra-simple Ferriss-style:

* meat & non-starch veggies
* w/ a side of legumes & kettlebell swings
* & 1 _helluva'_ glutinous cheat day per week <br />(_what?_ Yeah the variance is actually productive)<br />..._mostly_ productive 😉

I'm already feeling like myself again

<!---
Before the pandemic, I had radically experimented with my nutrition over 2 years to evaporate my cholesterol problem & started weight training [freeweights of course] for the very first time in my life. After dialing in those habits, I consciously decided to halt everything in early February 2020 (even turned down 2 job offers! one after a FOUR HOUR phone negotiation where they made an exploitative offer that would've screwed me if the rumors about a pandemic were true & the other I actually accepting on condition that it was remote only for them to bait&switch me right before the start date) & optimize all of that to go complete survival mode &gotten into the best shape of my life post-pandemic. After a year of rationing on anything & everything that I can easily carry home that minimizes the number of trips I need to make to the grocery store, I've ballooned back to my all-time high weight. I don't know why it took me so long to recommit but as of last month I'm back on the horse & I feel [relatively] better about myself with each passing day

## Launched personal site & newsletter!

That's right:
<br />_there's more where this came from!_

Why?

I'm not here to advertise anything. My social network is increasingly global & I need a stable [digital] address to keep contact with friends. **My weekly newsletter is for anyone who wants to keep in-touch with me**, even when we can't justify a conversation every week or month.

_The social accountability is a nice plus too_

(If you stop enjoying it at any point, then just go ahead & unsubscribe: it's nothing personal. _Even if_ I happen to notice, I won't read into it.)

<!---
I don't feel a strong separation between people. I really don't care if we haven't met "in real life". make a distinction between friends I've met in-person & haven't. "very close friends" or who lives closer to me.
-->

<br />

The more reading & studying I do, the more I have to write & share. I've gotten to an exciting point in my life where I'm revisiting some deeply-held worldviews while sustaining an openness to mystery & wonder. The only thing I really know is that I don't. & yet [I've never wanted to Know™ as badly as I do now](/blog/liberal-arts).

The funny thing is that _I've always been_ a researcher, without realizing it. I only recently made a habit of writing stuff down. It forces me to take my ideas more seriously & hold myself to a higher standard of rigor. **Why not share that with those most invested in me?** I believe everyone has something to teach us.

> Let's build futures worth building

<!---
What makes it even cooler is expressing it isn't just for free. I get compounding returns to forcibly clarifying my thoughts much further than before. The act of recalling information actually reinforces it & expressing my thoughts nudges me towards consuming higher-quality ideas.

## [TODO: any other major GTD-style projects]

The.


* Living in the heart of downtown Indianapolis with an awesome partner
* self-studying entirely new interests in geography, world history, & jumping around the western canon (reconsidering a lot of worldviews after thinking outside the U.S., searching earnestly for lost ideas on technological progressinnovative cultures, lost ideas on technological progress, & tracking the symbiotic coevolution of humanity with technology)

How you can help:


* job searching
* building my case for tech optimism
* [note: keep these limited to GTD-style outcomes I'm reaching for]
* shipping daily updates to this cwc (+now this site)
* designing a better WFH lifestyle trying to make more internet friends outside the US (i.e. neglecting local relationships in favor of global ones [link sivers essay])
* finally strength training again for the first time since the pandemic (I've slowly ballooned up to college-grad weight & lack of shape RIGHT after the best shape & blood lipids of my life)
* [TODO: just do a GTD weekly review & that will inform this page]
-->



<!---
>  TODO: get nownownow backlink

* writing & shipping daily for >CWC (new-age "creator economy" small business some day in 5 years)

* REALLY enjoying remote work (especially as excuse to dail-in routine + nutrition + workouts)
* open & searching for work. I'm getting extremely excited about collaboration again, as I recently figured out I wasn't searching for "freedom from" but "freedom to"nimmerse myself more deeply with others (hey, [OnDeck](/why-ondeck))

...

* Living with my long-term girlfriend in downtown Indianapolis for the near-term & trying to discover my dream, long-term city [TODO: show candidates] ...I have a lurking suspicion that it will probably be a satellite city for remote work, even though global trends suggest that people are increasingly urbanizing

* Self-teaching more liberal arts (I've long been a die-hard STEM kid & I think it's the most practical. I both believe that STEM is one of the more important things to START learning with, so that you have a utilitarian/practical place to integrate yourself into the world, but as time passes: I both feel that Liberal Arts is both MORE & LESS important than STEM. Less in that it shouldn't really precede STEM ...ideally, I think a more optimal balance is to focus more purely on current capacities/technologies/etc earlier in education BEFORE you mature onto what is ultmately more important. I didn't have the stomach or capcity for history, social studies, philosophy before, but now I have a life with real-world objectives that shine context & make it immensely useful. So let me be clear: I've recently come to appreciate Liberal Arts as a higher goal, but only insofar as I have the capcity to concern mself with them. I think we've had a recent overproduction of liberal arts education as evidenced by all the recent grads that  don't find themselves a good place to start in the world. Liberal arts isn't given, it's earned. In short, I've come to understand that logic isn't a strict subset of math. They are seperate neterprises & most of this is the necesary move from studying the world of the deductive to the world of the inductive.) ... in theory if I were to raise kids today, I would STEM them to heck for the first 20 years so they're super effective operators in the world, then graudate them onto the higher, ongoing never-ending conversations of Liberal Arts, but now rooted in real-world urgency & NEVER letting their eyes of the dashboard controls & immediacy of life.)
