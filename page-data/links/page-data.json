Every decision you make is a vote for the person you'll become. <strong>This is the lazy-yet-informed approach to maximize your returns <em>relative to your risk &#x26; effort</em></strong>. Recall that tired 80/20 saying about \"the 20% of efforts that will yield you 80% of the results\"?</p>\n<p>In my experience,\n<br />you'll take this 1 of 2 ways\n<br />(assuming this is new to you):</p>\n<p>Some people are so ecstatic that they binge this kinda stuff for months, but\nothers...<br />let's just say<br /><em>it's not their idea of fun</em></p>\n<br />\n<p>If you're already intimidated or overwhelmed at the mere idea of counting up all the bills on your counter or fees in your accounts, you're probably suffering from a backwards case of \"grass is greener\". Ignorance is not bliss &#x26; you know it: it eats away at you from the inside until you're a hollow shell of your former self. Getting clear on \"your finances\" is the only antidote to stress, the only therapy of its kind. <strong>For some of you, thinking about money is like eating broken glass &#x26; staring into the abyss</strong>, when it's actually more like roping off a crime scene &#x26; getting the victims the answers they deserve.</p>\n<p>You may think you have nothing, that you're doomed, but a quick google search will find you many stories of people that have gotten out of significantly more dire financial circumstances. Just because you have 40k/80k/120k in student loan debt &#x26; several thousand in credit card debt is far from the end of the world.</p>\n<p><strong>The grass really is greener on the other side</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p>I recently wrote about <a href=\"https://creatorswhocode.com/blog/whose-ladder\">\"Whose Ladder Are You Climbing?\"</a> when it dawned on me that <strong>many \"career ladders\" felt more like spider webs of someone else's design</strong> to tie me up &#x26; bite my head off. Without getting to know you, I'd consider this one of the few ladders worth investing the time to climb. What matters is that it's a climb <em>of your own design</em>.</p>\n<p>Best of all, the top of whatever ladder you choose it is probably <em>way</em> lower than you think! You almost certainly don't need to park your dreams behind some arbitrary \"ermm, 3 million??\" number [assuming no  extreme inflation]. I've met people that said with a straight face that they'd need a couple billion to do what they \"really\" want to do. Don't be this person. There are probably opportunities to get 60% of the experience for 1% of the cost. This corner case was precisely the reason Tim Ferriss wrote the scammy-sounding-by-design-but-100%-legit-&#x26;-game-changing book \"The 4-Hour Workweek\" (you could probably preview the first 2 chapters on Amazon for free if you're that curious)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"How come there's no 'life essentials' class in high school???

This isn't the be-all end-all on the art of investing for people who've entirely escaped the game of money, but this could be a more sustainable path <em>to get you there</em>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>What if you're a trigger-happy capitalist who wants to YOLO more than 1% of your net worth into speculative investments?

He now prefers the term eco-pragmatist. We can't go back & we can't afford to slow innnnovations on the horizon. Even if you're a proud tree-hugger who thinks that _\"industrial civilization has committed crimes, sins against nature, and retribution is coming\"_ ...then he's a respectful, sympathetic voice who learned some hard lessons.\n\nWe all have something to learn from someone who has been on the frontier of the environmental movement since the '60s & '70s. This is the only exception to my rule for this page because the exact link to him isn't as important as his perspective that has loomed over me.  There may be better summaries, but this short interview is a brief enough introduction to his current thinking.\n\n-->\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h3 id=\"memorable-quotes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#memorable-quotes\" aria-label=\"memorable quotes permalink\" class=\"markdown-header before\"><div class='markdown-header-link'></div></a>Memorable Quotes</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact:<br /><br /><strong>everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.</strong> And you can change it, you can influence it...<br /><br />Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.\"</em> <br />--<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw\">Steve Jobs</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"...in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. <strong>There is no such thing as not worshipping.
