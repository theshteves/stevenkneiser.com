I'm weight training for the first time ever (&#x26; consistently at that). I've radically experimented with my diet &#x26; I'm not even unfalsifiably opinionated or cult-like about my particular approach to nutrition. My blood lipids have remarkably reversed course &#x26; I'm ...underweight?</p>\n<p><em>~ the-virus-that-shall-not-be-named knocks on the door ~</em></p>\n<p><strong>January 2021</strong>: I'm in the worst shape of my life. Maybe I should ask my doctor abou— oh, those are just called stretch marks 😩</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>June 2021</strong>: Alright, no more worst-case prepping. I can stop sprinting pre-planned routes through grocery stores &#x26; leaf through fresh ingredients to cook again. Let's return to the ultra-simple Ferriss-style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>protein, non-starch veggies, <em>&#x26; lots of legumes!</em></li>\n<li>w/ a side of kettlebell swings (5 minutes, 2x weekly)</li>\n<li>&#x26; 1 <em>anything</em>-goes cheat day of gluttony per week <br />(wait what? Yeah, the metabolic variance is actually productive)<br />...<em>mostly</em> productive 😉</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm already feeling like myself again</p>\n<br />\n<p><strong>December 2021 update:</strong> I've never had my diet so dialed in! <strong>I shed a consistent ~5.5 pounds monthly</strong> until I reached my true form (that includes going out of my way most Saturdays to gain lots of water weight eating my vices in excess). Those improvements came almost exclusively from cleaning up my nutrition. Now I'm very slowly dialing up the cardio &#x26; weight training to compensate for my sedentary work life 👨‍💻</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2 id=\"lets-hop-on-the-phone\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#lets-hop-on-the-phone\" aria-label=\"lets hop on the phone permalink\" class=\"markdown-header before\"><div class='markdown-header-link'></div></a>Let's hop on the phone!</h2>\n<p><em>Since only the smartest, funniest, &#x26; most attractive readers such as yourself read this far...</em> my calendar is particularly open for the next few months if you love chatting on the phone or Zoom.
