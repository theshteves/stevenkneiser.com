It's got almost everything, but the entire world is urbanizing & I'm keeping an eye out for exceptional satellite cities. I think remote work was largely overhyped because social media hasn't innovated enough to make online communities intimate enough. The worldwide web will ge tthere, but I believe very strongly we're not even in the Day 1 of the internet. 95% of \"remote work\" will recede because they don't have enough operational & cultural sophistication to support asynchronous work yet. The pandemic was an external force, but the shif tto remote work needs to be an internal suction because the tools are so good. They're great, but they're not there yet (e.g. Slack repulses the average employee way more than it pulls in with excitment). Once there are better online conference tools (I have no clue. It might take as much as mass adoption of more affordable next-gen augmented reality). Still on the search for the ideal city\n\nDon't forget awesome partner & 2 cats\n\n> _\"The unexamined life is not worth living\"_<br />--Socrates (but not in English)<br />... --Plato (documented in his \"Apology\")<br />... ... --Michael Scott\n-->\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Returning to software</h2>\n<p>This update ultimately became a dedicated essay:</p>\n<figure class='flex my-8 text-4xl bg-gradient-to-bl from-yellow-50 via-yellow-50 to-yellow-300 w-max p-4 rounded items-center'>\n  <div class='px-4'>üë®‚Äçüíª </div>\n  <a href='/blog/return-to-software'>My Return To Software</a>\n</figure>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Reading like I'm running out of time</h2>\n<p>Apparently I've been writing like I'm running out of time too.

I'm weight training for the first time in my life (&#x26; consistently at that). I've radically experimented with my diet &#x26; I'm not even unfalsifiably opinionated or cult-like about my particular approach to nutrition. My blood lipids have remarkably reversed course &#x26; I'm even underweight.</p>\n<p><em>~ the-virus-that-shall-not-be-named knocks on the door ~</em></p>\n<p><strong>January 2021</strong>: I'm in the worst shape of my life. Maybe I should ask my doctor abou-- oh, those are just called stretch marks üôÉ ...at least now I can cut my own hair! <em>If only I could do more than shave it off</em></p>\n<p><strong>June 2021</strong>: Alright, no more worst-case prepping. I can start grabbing fresh ingredients twice weekly &#x26; cooking again. Let's try out the ultra-simple Ferriss-style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>meat &#x26; veggies</li>\n<li>w/ a side of legumes &#x26; kettlebell swings</li>\n<li>&#x26; 1 <em>helluva'</em> glutinous cheat day per week</li>\n</ul>\n<!---\nBefore the pandemic, I had radically experimented with my nutrition over 2 years to evaporate my cholesterol problem & started weight training [freeweights of course] for the very first time in my life. After dialing in those habits, I consciously decided to halt everything in early February 2020 (even turned down 2 job offers! one after a FOUR HOUR phone negotiation where they made an exploitative offer that would've screwed me if the rumors about a pandemic were true & the other I actually accepting on condition that it was remote only for them to bait&switch me right before the start date) & optimize all of that to go complete survival mode &gotten into the best shape of my life post-pandemic. After a year of rationing on anything & everything that I can easily carry home that minimizes the number of trips I need to make to the grocery store, I've ballooned back to my all-time high weight. I don't know why it took me so long to recommit but as of last month I'm back on the horse & I feel [relatively] better about myself with each passing day\n-->\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Still Writing daily for CreatorsWhoCode</h2>\n<p>We're approaching Day 400 of shipping public updates daily</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TODO: elaborate</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h2>Ramping up writing to launch personal newsletter!</h2>\n<p>That's right:\n<em>there's more where this came from!</em></p>\n<p>The more reading &#x26; studying I do, the more I have to write &#x26; share.

I both believe that STEM is one of the more important things to START learning with, so that you have a utilitarian/practical place to integrate yourself into the world, but as time passes: I both feel that Liberal Arts is both MORE & LESS important than STEM. Less in that it shouldn't really precede STEM ...ideally, I think a more optimal balance is to focus more purely on current capacities/technologies/etc earlier in education BEFORE you mature onto what is ultmately more important. I didn't have the stomach or capcity for history, social studies, philosophy before, but now I have a life with real-world objectives that shine context & make it immensely useful. So let me be clear: I've recently come to appreciate Liberal Arts as a higher goal, but only insofar as I have the capcity to concern mself with them. I think we've had a recent overproduction of liberal arts education as evidenced by all the recent grads that  don't find themselves a good place to start in the world. Liberal arts isn't given, it's earned. In short, I've come to understand that logic isn't a strict subset of math. They are seperate neterprises & most of this is the necesary move from studying the world of the deductive to the world of the inductive.) ... in theory if I were to raise kids today, I would STEM them to heck for the first 20 years so they're super effective operators in the world, then graudate them onto the higher, ongoing never-ending conversations of Liberal Arts, but now rooted in real-world urgency & NEVER letting their eyes of the dashboard controls & immediacy of life.)\n\n  * Studying the Western Canon\n  * Trying to decentralize my philosophy from the US\n  * Building the case for Tech Optimism\n  * Studying geography & geopolitics\n\n<br />\n\n## Recent Reading\n\n* The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (audiobook by the author himself is a perfect motivation to go to bed early)\n* ...\n\n<br />\n\n## Favorite Quote:\n\n* \"happy is the country without a history\"\n* \"... something someting life is a crisis & yet we still live\"\n* darwin on survival of most adaptable > smartest > strongest\n\n## What I'm geeking out about\n\n* Isaac Arthur on Futurism\n* CaspianReport on Geopolitics\n* Atlas Pro on Geography\n* The massive works of Britannica & Wikipedia\n* The Western Canon‚Ñ¢ (classic books throughout history that shifted Western Thought)\n* Lingco??? on languages\n* Effective Altruism\n* Open Philantrhopy\n\n* David's essay on serious christians\n* Long Now lecture by Singapore UN ambassador\n* worldview diversification: ajeya\n\n<br />\n\n> TODO: include calendly link for friends (or at least call-to-action to text, twitter DM, or email me)\n-->\n<p><br /><br /></p>\n<h1>Let's catch up!</h1>\n<p>Since only the smart, funny, &#x26; attractive people such as yourself made it this far, my calendar is particularly open for the next few months if you love chatting on the phone or Zoom.
