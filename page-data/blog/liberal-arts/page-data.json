The Technical Arts are more urgent: young adults can build independence when they engage with the industries &#x26; crafts of their time. There's only one problem: crafts evolve faster every generation (especially since the Industrial Revolution).</p>\n<p>Why are these two arts\n<br />even discussed in the same sentence?\n<br />even discussed in the same institutions?</p>\n<p>Sure, The Technical Arts offer an antidote to dependency, but what about engaging in the awe-inspiring world around us, with people nothing like us? One day—like it or not—<strong>we all must graduate to the stage of The Liberal Arts, if we want to contribute to these timeless &#x26; borderless dialogues.</strong> You don't <em>have</em> to. You don't even have to contribute <em>productively</em>. But <strong>if you want to be heard at the innovative, future-frothing fringes of industry, you don't have a choice.</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p>I was wrong</p>\n<p>I was wrong all along\n<br />so consider this my love song:</p>\n<p>Liberal Arts degrees are often wasted on the young &#x26; inexperienced who have nothing at stake. <strong>The Liberal Arts don't belong baked behind college degrees: they are the products powering the heights of humanity's collective computation.</strong> The Liberal Arts are but an ever-evolving conversation that belies the burden of adulthood.</p>\n<p>You're in this for life, literally</p>\n<br />\n<p>There’s no escape\n<br />There’s no graduation\n<br />So join the conversation</p>\n<p>Adults get pop quizzes too\n<br />just with graver consequences</p>\n<p>This is your only second chance\n<br />Skip the reading at your own risk</p>\n<br />\n<p><em>...you ARE reading this time, right?</em></p>"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"60e90029-b2ec-5506-80a0-44ec2d85a197","frontmatter__permalink":"/blog/liberal-arts","__params":{"frontmatter__permalink":"blog"}}},
