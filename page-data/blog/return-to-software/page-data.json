Pure magic. I could see it all right then &#x26; there from the Quadratic Formula in Algerba II: <strong>coding is a real-life superpower</strong>. The thought of typing something into existence seemed no different from fictional wizards/sorcerers/magicians who chant cryptic words that actually summon strange things into existence. As children, we grasp for any sign that we are one-of-a-kind, that our story will be told like the others' we've heard, that we alone might be the protagonist.</p>\n<p>Santa Claus was no longer real, but at last I'd found a crack in my own reality. What castles in the sky would this superpower lift me to?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\"</em> --Arthur C. Clarke</p>\n</blockquote>\n<br />\n<p>When I finished college,\n<br />I wasn't the average Computer Science student who just showed up to classes &#x26; took my tests. I did every single thing I could outside of the classroom to master my craft:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>participated at 30+ hackathons</li>\n<li>gave technical workshops</li>\n<li>kept up with trendiest technologies</li>\n<li>led inter-discplinary teams including artists &#x26; designers</li>\n<li>revived a dead club</li>\n<li>shipped 10+ products</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd collaborated with skilled artists &#x26; designers, I'd coordinated teams, &#x26; I even worked at a big tech company (not once, but twice).</p>\n<p><strong>Personally, I didn't stumble out of college with a degree, but a formidable 3 years of product management experience</strong> (especially in rapid prototyping)</p>\n<p><strong>But I had enough</strong>: I had already climbed the mountain I came to climb</p>\n<p>I didn't need to \"start my career\"\n<br /><strong>I was ready for the next chapter</strong></p>\n<br />\n<p>When you run out of role models,\n<br />you need new blueprints</p>\n<p>But where else to look?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TODO: elaborate</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\n<p>I now had enough tools in my toolbelt, that technical competence wasn't my bottleneck any more. I wasn't the type to just sit down &#x26; cash in on those skills for the next decade. I wanted more. <strong>I wanted to understand \"the Businessâ„¢ side\".</strong> I wanted to build companies of own so that I could employ all my friends &#x26; build the software we saw in the world</p>\n<p>...but I had 1 nagging, existential question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>even if</em> I could build anything I wanted<br /><br /><em>even if</em> I could get better at managing a larger team to build quicker<br /><br /><strong>what did that matter ...if I couldn't figure out <em>which</em> problems were <em>most worth</em> solving?</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>I needed perspective<br />&#x26; from <em>outside</em> my domain of expertise</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TODO: elaborate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I've always loved software, but I'm big on communication: I want to relate to others outside software. I'm a craftsperson who loves to chat just as much with marketers &#x26; salespeople about their craft. My high school tagline was \"always ready to pull back the curtain &#x26; study the clockwork\" &#x26; that's never changed.</p>\n<p>I invested a few years to better understand \"business\" &#x26; the entire revenue-side of organizations. But I never intended to leave my background behind. It's true that the half-life of technical knowledge is shortening, so I want to re-engage with the craft of software as long as I can keep up.</p>\n<p><strong>So I might be a little rusty,\n<br />but I'm back</strong>\n<br/>&#x26; this time I know where I want to go</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TODO: more to come</li>\n</ul>\n<!---\nI started my coding journey before college & before I knew it was a well-paying career path (even though that helped me to commit long-term). If it were any other way, I wouldn't find myself constantly returning to it after time off.  Sure, it's something I enjoy, but it's always for a different purpose:\n-->\n<!---\n3 questions \n\nI got obsessed with distribution.\n\n& now I'm back at  the begininning: great product is what matters. Turns out \"distribution\" is a double-edged sword: however good or bad your  product/service is, good distribution merely spreads the word faster. In this sense, poor distribution is an advantage because it gives you room to experiment & fail brutally without permanent reputational damage, even if I'm oversimplifying.\n\nIf my life were a video game, this is like I beat the game once  already, so I'm ready to come back to the first level.\n-->\n<!---\nsoftware -> entrepreneurship -> digital marketing -> sales -> writer -> software (but this time it's different) -> DevRel??? No-Code Ops?? solo-creator?? startup mercenary??\n-->"}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"51ccfa6b-caa9-5530-b297-ae95d675c47d","frontmatter__permalink":"/blog/return-to-software","__params":{"frontmatter__permalink":"blog"}}},
